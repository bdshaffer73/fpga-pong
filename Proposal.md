# Pong Game Proposal #

  * Patryk Giza and Zach Morgan
  * ECE 287-Digital Systems Design F'14
  * Dr Jamieson

## Description ##
Patryk Giza and Zach Morgan propose to recreate Atari's video game, Pong on an Altera DE2-115 FPGA Board. The board will collect input from an external keyboard and output the video to a monitor connected via VGA. The game will be 2 player, with each player getting their own controls on the keyboard.
## Project Breakdown ##
  * Research the VGA output and implementation through the FPGA
  * implement the VGA output through simple geometries
  * begin to learn how to draw and move objects around the screen
  * Research and learn the keyboard inputs as well as interfacing with a keyboard
  * implement the keyboard input, with the geometries being moved along with the input
  * begin by doing a basic version of the game, with just 1 paddle and the ball
  * deal with the "collisions" of the screen edges as well as the paddle
  * get the paddle to move
  * implement the 2nd player and get their paddle to interact appropriately
  * place a scorekeeper

## Goals ##
  * To Learn more about Verilog
  * Learn and utilize the DE2-115 Board for image output
  * Utilize keyboard inputs within the board
  * Use out Knowledge gained in ECE 287 to make a video game
