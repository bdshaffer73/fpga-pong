Description
We will recreate Atari's video game, Pong on an Altera DE2-115 FPGA Board. The board will collect input from an external keyboard and output the video to a monitor connected via VGA. The game will be 2 player, with each player getting their own controls on the keyboard.
Project Breakdown
-Research the VGA output and implementation through the FPGA
-implement the VGA output through simple geometries
-begin to learn how to draw and move objects around the screen
-Research and learn the keyboard inputs as well as interfacing with a keyboard
-implement the keyboard input, with the geometries being moved along with the input
-begin by doing a basic version of the game, with just 1 paddle and the ball
-deal with the "collisions" of the screen edges as well as the paddle
-get the paddle to move
-implement the 2nd player and get their paddle to interact appropriately
-utilize some memory to keep score
